### Overview
An interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing **passenger reviews for American Airlines**.  
The dashboard provides a multi-dimensional view of customer sentiment across time, geography, and aircraft type, enabling quick insights into strengths and improvement areas.

---

### How It Was Built
- **Data Cleaning in Tableau**: Performed all cleaning and preparation directly in Tableau using built-in tools — handled nulls, standardized categories, and reformatted fields directly in Tableau
- **Calculated Fields**:  
  - Created metrics such as *Average Ratings* for each service aspect (Cabin Staff Service, Entertainment, Food & Beverages, Seat Comfort, Ground Service, and Value for Money).
  - Built KPIs for dynamic display in the dashboard header.
- **Interactive Controls**:  
  - Added radio button selectors for metrics (e.g., Overall Rating, Entertainment, Food).  
  - Integrated **sliders** for date filtering (2017–2025) to let users focus on specific time periods.
  - Filters for Traveller Type, Seat Type, Aircraft, and Continent for drill-down analysis.

---

### Key Dashboard Features
- **KPI Header** — Displays average ratings for each service dimension at a glance.
- **Map View** — *Average Overall Rating by Country* to visualize regional performance.
- **Trend Chart** — *Average Overall Rating by Month* showing sentiment changes over time.
- **Aircraft Comparison** — Bar charts showing ratings and number of reviews per aircraft model.
- **Cross-Filtering** — Selecting filters updates all visualizations instantly.

### 🔍 Insights from the Data
From analyzing the available data:
- Overall rating sits at **~2.9**, indicating **below-average customer satisfaction**.
- **Cabin Staff Service** scored relatively better (3.0) than **Entertainment** (1.0) or **Value for Money** (2.5).
- Certain aircraft types (e.g., 777) received slightly higher ratings compared to others.
- Geographic variation suggests different regional perceptions — potentially tied to route quality or service standards.

---

### Business Impact
If presented to American Airlines leadership, this dashboard could:
- Pinpoint **service areas needing immediate attention** (e.g., in-flight entertainment, perceived value for money).
- Identify **routes or regions with lower satisfaction** for targeted service improvements.
- Highlight **aircraft-specific feedback trends** that could guide fleet deployment or refit priorities.
- Track **impact of improvement initiatives over time** through the date slider and monthly rating trends.
- Serve as a **real-time performance monitoring tool** for both customer experience and brand perception.
